# Plants-vs-Zombies
In Plants vs. Zombies, players take on the role of a homeowner during a zombie apocalypse. The objective is to use various plants, each with unique abilities, to prevent waves of zombies from reaching the player's house. The game is played on a grid where plants can be strategically placed to fend off advancing zombies.
